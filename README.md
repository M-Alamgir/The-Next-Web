# The-Next-Web

A clone of [TNW](https://ourandco.github.io/The-Next-Web/)'s home page. The website is build using the modern `css`, `html` and media queries techniques to make it responsive.

The website is fully responsive with the help of two `media query` `breakpoints` namely: `< 768px`, `>= 768px`, `>= 1024px`.
